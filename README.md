# Moomo

Moomo is a beautifully designed mood tracking and mindfulness app that helps you record, understand, and manage your emotions with ease. It combines intuitive UI, powerful data visualization, and AI-powered comfort to support your mental well-being every day.

## Features

### 1. Quick Mood Logging
Easily record your current mood by tapping on an expressive emoji. You can also add a text note to describe your feelings in more detail. Mood logging is fast, simple, and encourages daily use.

### 2. Multiple Emotion Types
Moomo supports six common emotions: **Joy, Sadness, Surprise, Disgust, Anger, and Fear**. Each emotion has a unique cartoon icon and color, making it easy and fun to express your feelings visually.

### 3. Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Views
Switch between daily, weekly, and monthly views to review your emotional history. The app provides a clear overview of your mood patterns, whether you want to see details for a specific day or trends over a longer period.

### 4. Mood Data Visualization
All your mood records are visualized with charts and color blocks. Instantly see your recent emotional distribution and trends, helping you better understand your emotional health.

### 5. AI Comfort & Mindfulness Guidance
When you feel down, simply tap the Pie button. Moomo uses OpenAI GPT to generate a warm, mindful comfort message based on your mood and description, often quoting literary works to encourage and help you process complex emotions.

### 6. Desktop & iOS Widget
Moomo offers a desktop and iOS widget for quick mood logging. Tap an emoji directly on your home screen to add your mood. The widget adapts to different screen sizes and provides a seamless, efficient experience.

### 7. Local & Secure Data Storage
All your mood data is stored locally on your device to protect your privacy. Future updates will support cloud sync for easy data management across multiple devices.
